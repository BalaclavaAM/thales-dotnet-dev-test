- **Angular**: The client-side code is built with Angular, a popular and robust JavaScript framework for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript with additional static typing, making it more maintainable and scalable.
- **Bootstrap**: The application uses Bootstrap for responsive layout and styling, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly design across different devices.
- **Client-Side Navigation**: This SPA provides client-side navigation, enabling users to move between different sections of the application without page reloads.
- **Unit Tests with Visual Studio SDK**: The project includes unit tests that can be run using the Visual Studio SDK, ensuring the quality and reliability of the codebase.
